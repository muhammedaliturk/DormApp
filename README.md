# DormApp
Automation application for student dormitories

student using DormApp;

Will be able to see the announcements/events and indicate whether or not to participate in the events in the form of voting,

will be able to see the occupancy status of the existing washing and drying machines in the dormitory.

If the machines are full, they will be able to see who is using them or how many minutes until the machine program is finished.

will be able to see the food list in the cafeteria in the form of weekly and monthly tables.

will be able to pay dormitory fees with virtual POS.

will be able to communicate with the administrator through the application.

will be able to get permission out through the app.

The visual parts of the application will become more beautiful in the future. Right now I'm just concentrating on the backend part.
